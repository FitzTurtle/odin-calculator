# odin-calculator

This is my attempt at the odin-calculator project.

I believe I have achieved all of the normal objectives.
For the extra credit objectives I was able to:
- Allow for floating point numbers using a single decimal place in each number
- Make it look presentable
- Allowed for keypresses from numpad to allow to keypad input


Unable... Or unwilling? To implement backstroke button. With how I built equations I would have to either find a way to reverse parse my currentEquation string and re-assign the variables, while resetting states at the same time, or I would have to only allow editing of the present number.
